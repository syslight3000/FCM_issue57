Elizabeth Krumbach: Can you tell us a little about yourself?

Elizabeth Krumbach: 可以先介绍一下自己吗？

Gema Gomez-Solano (above): I love good software and computers. When I was at high school, and I watched the film Sneakers, I decided to become a Computer Engineer. I admired those computer wizards who could do almost anything with a keyboard. I really wanted to be part of a group that could do cool things with technology, no matter how complicated.


Gema Gomez-Solano (above)：我喜欢好的软件和电脑。在中学的时候，我看过《通天神偷》之后，我就决定长大了要当一个电脑工程师。当时我很佩服那些计算机高手，他们几乎可以用键盘做各种事情。我当时非常希望能成为他们中的一员，用技术实现一些很酷的事情，不管这些事情有多复杂。

I studied Computer Engineering in Barcelona, Spain; a Master equivalent degree at the Catalonia Polytechnic University. After finishing university, I was hired by a security company in Barcelona to do security audits and assessments.

我在西班牙巴塞罗那的加泰罗尼亚理工大学就读计算机工程专业，一个等同于加泰罗尼亚理工大学硕士的学位。毕业后，我受聘于巴塞罗那一家安全公司，负责安全审计和评估的工作。

In 2004, given my security background, I was offered a role in London as a Test Engineer at Symbian within the security team. This was my first time working at an English company, and in an international environment. We had teams in the UK and India, and later in China. Testing an operating system was one of the most complex and enlightening experiences of my career. I grew as a tester and as a QA engineer during the first years there. The security team moved to Cambridge and I decided to stay in London doing integration testing within the kernel team.

在2004年，因为有着计算机安全领域的工作经验，我在伦敦的塞班公司中受聘为安全小组的一名测试工程师。这是我首次在英国的公司工作，而且在国际的环境底下。我们有来自英国及印度，还有中国的团队。测度操作系统是我的职业里其中一个最复杂和启发性的经验。在那里的第一年，我从一名测试员成长为一名QA工程师。之后安全小组搬到剑桥，而且我则继续留在伦敦与内核团队做综合测试。

Then, in 2007, Symbian decided they wanted to build a strong System Test team, and offered me the Technology Architect position for that team. We built a technically strong test team who changed the quality of the OS visibly and for good. It felt great to see that project develop after all the battles that we had to fight to make it happen.

之后，在2007年，塞班公司决定要成立一个强大的测试团队，并且受予我成为该团队的技术建筑师。我们成建立了强大的技术测试团队，主要负责系统的能见度和产品的质量。令人高兴地看到的是计划在所有必需争取做到的测试后得以发展。

Then Nokia took over Symbian, and announced it was going to become open-source. After spending 9 months helping the team to integrate in the new organisation, I decided to take some time off to rethink my career to find the next challenge. I had seen the team grow and establish itself as a smoothly running testing team, so my job there felt done and I was eager to find a new project that I could help develop and build.

之后诺基亚收购寒班，并且宣告它将成为开源。在花费了9个月的时间去帮助团队整合到新的公司，我决定用休息一段时间去重新思考我的职业寻找下一个挑战。我已经看到团队自我成长和发展为一个流畅运作的团伍，到此我在这的工作已经完成，从而渴望找到一个我能够帮助去建立和发展的新计划。

As my next challenge I took up an opportunity to join VMware in London. I did API testing for almost a year with them but it didn't really feel like the challenge I had been seeking. So I kept trying to find what I was looking for, and that's how I came across Canonical and the Ubuntu project. It was an operating system; it was in need of testing if it was to become the predominant OS. And, most importantly, it was a chance to collaborate with a great community from around the globe. This opportunity got my attention instantly, and, when I was offered the QA Engineer position, I didn't hesitate.

作为我下一个的挑战，我获得一个加入伦敦VMware公司的机会。我替它们做API测试差不多一年，但感觉不像我要找的挑战。所以我继续尝试去寻找，也就是我如何遇到Canonical公司及Ubuntu计划的经过。它是一个操作系统，如果它想成为优越的系统还需要测试。而且最重要的是，这是与世界各地庞大社区合作的一个机会。这个机会立即引起了我的重视，之后当我接受QA工程师的聘请时，我毫不犹疑。

Five months and one UDS down the line, it still feels good and lots of things are starting to happen within the Canonical Platform QA team and within the community in terms of QA. I enjoy seeing how my work has a direct impact on a system used by millions worldwide. I would like to see Ubuntu become the operating system everyone uses and that comes with every computer that is sold. Most importantly, I personally would like to see the QA work that we are doing for Ubuntu become a de facto standard in terms of quality assurance and good testing practices.
	
EK: How and when did you first get involved with open-source?

GG: The first time I thought about open-source as a way of making software was when I was told Symbian was becoming open-source. We had to think about how to make our code available to everyone, as well as keeping the continuous integration and testing of the code going. That was the first time I really thought about the concept of open-source, and realised how powerful the idea is.

My partner has been a developer of an open-source project, Dragonfly BSD, for some time now. I have seen him work on that project, and interact with its community, for years. He tried to convince me to do testing for them - but I was so busy with my day-to-day work that I never had enough quality time to dedicate to that.

So my first real taste of open-source, and being part of a community, has been with Canonical and the Ubuntu Project. I am learning to work with the community and to bounce ideas back and forth until they become work items and get implemented. Initially, the QA list felt somewhat lifeless, and the community was a bit stuck on what it was doing. Not much collaboration was going on so we split some of the tasks our team was doing this cycle, and made them available to the community. We've raised the awareness of testing, and plenty of community members have started to collaborate with us, and a lot of discussions are going on at the moment regarding the future of QA in Ubuntu. All geared towards taking the quality of Ubuntu to the next level.

I have also started talking to the Mozilla QA team regarding a test case management tool (Case Conductor) they are creating that we would like to use for Ubuntu as well. They are keen on collaborating, and would like to gather requirements from us so that the tool is fit for purpose for Ubuntu, too. We will soon be involved in beta-testing and other collaboration with the Mozilla team on this tool. So inter-community collaboration is something I am exploring at the moment.

EK: What is your role within the Ubuntu Project?

GG: I started working for the Platform QA team at Canonical back in August, and I have been watching the project during the final stages of Oneiric Ocelot as well as learning more about Linux and the community.

I wrote a high level strategy of what I think needs to happen in the coming 2 years for our quality levels to rise significantly. The plan was well received at the management team, and we got a green light to start implementing it. I have since moved to be the technical lead of the Platform QA team. We are currently working on putting the right tools in place so that developers can act on the important defects as soon as they are found. The Daily ISO testing is already following this principle, and its quality is improving noticeably as we speak. We are keeping track of the defects we find as part of our testing efforts, and of the defects we didn't find but are found later in the development cycle, so that we can improve the testing of future releases. Our overall aim is to build a solid automated testing suite as soon as we have the basics in place.

We changed the format of the meeting to make it more QA focussed, splitting it from the Bug Control meeting. Now both groups have different times to meet and discuss their issues and progress, and we have a set of tasks that community members are contributing to, with the aim of improving the quality of Ubuntu. I am driving and coordinating this effort at the moment, but this is not going to be my focus going forward since there will be a QA Community Coordinator with whom my team will collaborate closely and I will be just one more community contributor. The QA Platform team will be helping shape the testing effort and trying to make every little effort a worthwhile contribution to the whole. Historically, there has been little leadership in the QA front, and we are trying to bring good practices from the industry to the open-source community to improve the situation.

EK: Do you have any suggestions for others who are looking to get involved with Ubuntu and open-source in general?

GG: I think open-source is an unstoppable force that is driven by a huge worldwide community. I'd say the first step is to figure out what you want to do with your free time, then choose a project that you'd like to contribute to and see if they are in need of any of your skills; odds are they are. If you are a developer but do not want to write code in your free time, you might enjoy reviewing code or beta-testing a product to find problems, or triaging some bugs. Maybe you are good at languages and want to contribute by translating the software.

Or if you enjoy breaking software, and would like to do quality assurance and testing of a particular product, and you are prepared to join a very dynamic and challenging environment, I'd like to see an email from you on our ubuntu-qa@lists.ubuntu.com list (it's open to anyone: https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-qa ).

We are in the process of gathering as much help as we can get. The tasks that are being worked on at the moment at the community level for Precise are available on the wiki:
