## Ubuntu TV

`by Robin Catling`
`Robin Catling 著`

Canonical has taken the covers off Ubuntu TV, the latest technical product within the Ubuntu brand. Press coverage is synchronised across the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), selected news titles (PCPro among them) and on the Ubuntu website http://www.ubuntu.com/tv.

Canonical公司最近发布了Ubuntu旗下最新科技产品Ubuntu TV的有关信息；并在消费电子展（CES），以PC Pro为代表的制定刊物和Ubuntu官方网站 http://www.ubuntu.com/tv 上刊登了同步报道。

This is the first public look as Ubuntu TV, which, as Mark Shuttleworth promised, aims to broaden the reach of the Ubuntu open-source operating system beyond the PC - Ubuntu on everything tablets; smart-phones and TVs. Canonical is showing the first Ubuntu TV at CES in Las Vegas with an expectation of the first Ubuntu-powered television on sale by the end of this year. Tellingly, there are no announcements of partners or deals with any brand-name manufacturers in these announcements and Canonical CEO Jane Silber wouldn't name any in talks.

Mark Shuttleworth告诉记者，Ubuntu TV的首次公开亮相旨在推广Ubuntu开源系统在平板电脑、智能手机和电视机等非PC设备上的应用。Canonical准备在拉斯维加斯的CES上展示首个Ubuntu TV，并且预计在今年年底正式发售第一台基于Ubuntu的电视。不过值得注意的是，现在还没有任何有关合作伙伴和制造商的声明，并且Canonical的CEO Jane Silber也没有在讲话中透露相关信息。

Despite Google's renewed push on Google TV, it could be seen as a direct response to the rumours of Apple lining up a dramatic next generation of Apple TV. Just how Canonical intends to sit between these two tectonic plates, neither of which has a track record of success - yet - appears to rest on confidence; that device manufacturers want an open, neutral platform from a supplier that doesn't profit its' own brand at their expense.

尽管Google最近再次推广Google TV可以视作对有关苹果开发全新的下一代Apple TV传言的正面回应。Canonical似乎很有信心在还未获得成功的这两大巨头手中分得一杯羹；因为设备制造商们更希望能从一个不打算让他们来给自身品牌收益买单的供应商那里获得一个开源，中立的平台。

Although movie streaming services will be supported as well as live television broadcasts a major issue is going to be deals for content. In the meanwhile, you can glory in the Ubuntu TV interface, which, as we discussed on the podcast, could well be the killer application for which Unity was destined.

虽然对电影流服务和电视时况转播的支持将会带来内容处理上的问题。不过，就跟我们在播客中讨论过的一样，你会惊喜地发现Ubuntu TV界面将是Unity里的杀手级应用。

## Air Force Drone Controllers Embrace Linux

## 空军计划将Linux应用于无人机操控

"Last year, U.S. military drone control systems were infected with Windows USB worms. They seem to be moving the control systems to Linux now," said Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, via Twitter.

F-Secure公司的首席研究员Mikko Hypponen在Twitter上透露：“去年，美国军方无人机操控系统遭到了Windows USB蠕虫病毒的感染。他们现在似乎正打算将操纵系统转移到Linux上。”

As evidence of the apparent shift, he posted pictures of a drone control system from 2009 (the image was originally published by the Air Force), which appears to sport a Windows graphical user interface. For comparison, Hypponen then posted an unclassified slide (above) from a 2010 briefing that details Linux as being part of a 2011 upgrade.

他上传了空军官方2009年发布的一些有关无人机操控系统的图片来支持他的观点：这些图片中出现的控制器使用的是Windows图形用户界面。作为比较，Hypponen接着上传了一个2010年简报里的非机密幻灯片，上面将Linux列为了2011年系统升级计划的一部分。
