Elizabeth Krumbach: Can you tell us a little about yourself?

Elizabeth Krumbach: 可以先介绍一下自己吗？

Gema Gomez-Solano (above): I love good software and computers. When I was at high school, and I watched the film Sneakers, I decided to become a Computer Engineer. I admired those computer wizards who could do almost anything with a keyboard. I really wanted to be part of a group that could do cool things with technology, no matter how complicated.


Gema Gomez-Solano (above)：我喜欢优秀的软件和电脑。中学的时候，我看了《通天神偷》之后，我就决定，长大了要当一个电脑工程师。当时我非常佩服那些计算机高手，他们可以用键盘做各种事情。我当时非常希望能成为他们中的一员，用技术实现一些很酷的东西，不管这个东西有多复杂。

I studied Computer Engineering in Barcelona, Spain; a Master equivalent degree at the Catalonia Polytechnic University. After finishing university, I was hired by a security company in Barcelona to do security audits and assessments.

我在西班牙巴塞罗那的加泰罗尼亚理工大学读计算机工程专业，活动基本上等同于硕士的学位。毕业后，我受聘于巴塞罗那一家安全公司，工作主要是安全审计和评估。

In 2004, given my security background, I was offered a role in London as a Test Engineer at Symbian within the security team. This was my first time working at an English company, and in an international environment. We had teams in the UK and India, and later in China. Testing an operating system was one of the most complex and enlightening experiences of my career. I grew as a tester and as a QA engineer during the first years there. The security team moved to Cambridge and I decided to stay in London doing integration testing within the kernel team.

2004年，因为有计算机安全领域的工作经验，我在塞班公司的安全小组找到一份测试工程师的工作，地点是在伦敦。这是我第一次在跨国环境中为英国公司工作。我们小组最开始在英国和印度都有机构，后来中国也有了。做操作系统测试是我职业生涯中做过最复杂和最有启发的工作之一。在那工作一年之后，我成为了一名测试和QA工程师。后来安全小组搬到剑桥，但是我决定继续呆在伦敦在内核小组中做整合测试。

Then, in 2007, Symbian decided they wanted to build a strong System Test team, and offered me the Technology Architect position for that team. We built a technically strong test team who changed the quality of the OS visibly and for good. It felt great to see that project develop after all the battles that we had to fight to make it happen.

2007年是，塞班决定成立一个强大的测试小组，并给我在小组中提供了一个技术架构师职位。后来我们成为了保证操作系统质量和可用性的强力小组。看着我们客服项目中一个又一个困难，我感觉非常棒。

Then Nokia took over Symbian, and announced it was going to become open-source. After spending 9 months helping the team to integrate in the new organisation, I decided to take some time off to rethink my career to find the next challenge. I had seen the team grow and establish itself as a smoothly running testing team, so my job there felt done and I was eager to find a new project that I could help develop and build.

后来诺基亚收购了塞班并宣布即将开源。花了九个月时间帮助小组处理在新组织结构中的整合工作之后，我决定花一些时间重新思考下我的职业生涯，寻找下一个挑战。我亲眼看着我们的测试小组慢慢成长并顺利运作起来，所以我觉得我的工作也差不多该结束了，我迫切想找一个我能帮忙建设的新项目。

As my next challenge I took up an opportunity to join VMware in London. I did API testing for almost a year with them but it didn't really feel like the challenge I had been seeking. So I kept trying to find what I was looking for, and that's how I came across Canonical and the Ubuntu project. It was an operating system; it was in need of testing if it was to become the predominant OS. And, most importantly, it was a chance to collaborate with a great community from around the globe. This opportunity got my attention instantly, and, when I was offered the QA Engineer position, I didn't hesitate.

接下来新的挑战，我加入了伦敦的vmware。我在里面做了大概一年时间的API测试工作，但是感觉这并不是我一直在寻找的那种挑战的感觉。我还在继续寻找我想要的那种感觉，然后我碰到了Canonical和Ubuntu项目。这次是操作系统，优秀的操作系统必须要经过测试。同时很重要的一点是，和来自全世界的社区成员一起工作本来就很有挑战。这个挑战马上就吸引到我了，当他们给我提供了一个QA工程师的职位时，我毫不犹豫的接受了。

Five months and one UDS down the line, it still feels good and lots of things are starting to happen within the Canonical Platform QA team and within the community in terms of QA. I enjoy seeing how my work has a direct impact on a system used by millions worldwide. I would like to see Ubuntu become the operating system everyone uses and that comes with every computer that is sold. Most importantly, I personally would like to see the QA work that we are doing for Ubuntu become a de facto standard in terms of quality assurance and good testing practices.

过了五个月并完成一次UDS（一体化安全检测）之后，我感觉仍旧很好，Canonical的平台QA小组和社区的QA工作，很多事情都开始发生。看着我的工作能直接在全世界几百万人用的系统中体现出来，我感觉非常享受。我非常想看到人人都用ubuntu，所有出售的电脑都安装ubuntu。最重要的，我个人非常想看到我们为Ubuntu做的QA工作可以成为质量保证和测试实践的实际标准。
	
EK: How and when did you first get involved with open-source?

EK：你是在什么时候如何第一次接触到Open-Source的？

GG: The first time I thought about open-source as a way of making software was when I was told Symbian was becoming open-source. We had to think about how to make our code available to everyone, as well as keeping the continuous integration and testing of the code going. That was the first time I really thought about the concept of open-source, and realised how powerful the idea is.

GG：第一次知道还有开源这种软件开发方法是在北高值塞班即将开源的时候。这个时候我们就必须考虑如何让所有人都能得到我们的代码，同时还要继续保证代码的整合和测试工作。这就是我第一次了解到开源这个概念，并且意识到这是多么强大的一个想法。

My partner has been a developer of an open-source project, Dragonfly BSD, for some time now. I have seen him work on that project, and interact with its community, for years. He tried to convince me to do testing for them - but I was so busy with my day-to-day work that I never had enough quality time to dedicate to that.

我的搭档曾经是一个开源项目－－Dragonfly BSD的开发人员。好几年时间，我看到他在项目上工作并和社区进行交流。他想说服我为他们做测试工作，但我平日的工作实在是太忙了以至根本没时间放心思到这个上面。

So my first real taste of open-source, and being part of a community, has been with Canonical and the Ubuntu Project. I am learning to work with the community and to bounce ideas back and forth until they become work items and get implemented. Initially, the QA list felt somewhat lifeless, and the community was a bit stuck on what it was doing. Not much collaboration was going on so we split some of the tasks our team was doing this cycle, and made them available to the community. We've raised the awareness of testing, and plenty of community members have started to collaborate with us, and a lot of discussions are going on at the moment regarding the future of QA in Ubuntu. All geared towards taking the quality of Ubuntu to the next level.

所以我第一次作为社区成员参与到开源软件测试中还是Canonical和Ubuntu项目。我学习在社区中工作并反复总结并推动一些工作项目，直到最终得到部署。最开始，QA列表让人觉得是非常没有意思的工作，社区还不怎么接受QA的概念。协作进行的工作比较少，所以我们将这个cycle中的一些任务分离出来，让社区也可以参与进来。我们提高了大家对测试的意识，很多社区成员开始和我们合作，而且还有很多关于将来Ubuntu的QA要如何来做的讨论。所有一切都为Ubuntu更上一层楼做好了准备。

I have also started talking to the Mozilla QA team regarding a test case management tool (Case Conductor) they are creating that we would like to use for Ubuntu as well. They are keen on collaborating, and would like to gather requirements from us so that the tool is fit for purpose for Ubuntu, too. We will soon be involved in beta-testing and other collaboration with the Mozilla team on this tool. So inter-community collaboration is something I am exploring at the moment.

我开始和Mozilla QA小组讨论一个他们正在开发的测试案例管理工具，我也想将其用到Ubuntu项目上。他们合作非常热情，并愿意为了让这个工具也可以用于ubuntu为我们收集需求。我们很快就要加入到Mozilla QA小组做这个工具的beta测试了。我也在探索社区件的协作方式。

EK: What is your role within the Ubuntu Project?

EK：在Ubuntu项目中，你的角色是什么？

GG: I started working for the Platform QA team at Canonical back in August, and I have been watching the project during the final stages of Oneiric Ocelot as well as learning more about Linux and the community.

GG：8月的时候我开始在Canonical的平台QA小组工作，在Oneiric Ocelot的最后阶段中，我一直都在关注这个项目，并学习Linux和社区的事情。

I wrote a high level strategy of what I think needs to happen in the coming 2 years for our quality levels to rise significantly. The plan was well received at the management team, and we got a green light to start implementing it. I have since moved to be the technical lead of the Platform QA team. We are currently working on putting the right tools in place so that developers can act on the important defects as soon as they are found. The Daily ISO testing is already following this principle, and its quality is improving noticeably as we speak. We are keeping track of the defects we find as part of our testing efforts, and of the defects we didn't find but are found later in the development cycle, so that we can improve the testing of future releases. Our overall aim is to build a solid automated testing suite as soon as we have the basics in place.

我写了一个高级策划，关于接下来两年中如何显著提高我们的产品质量。管理层接受了我的计划，并允许我将其付诸实施。从那以来我一直担任平台QA小组的技术领导人。现在我们正在研究如何部署正确的工具，以便重大问题发现的时候，开发人员可以马上开始着手解决。日常的ISO测试目前已经开始按照这个原则进行，同时ISO的质量也有显著的提升。我们也跟踪我们自己测试中发现的和在开发周期中发现的缺陷，以便我们可以对将来发行版的测试进行改进。我们的总目标是一旦有了基础建立自动测试套件。

We changed the format of the meeting to make it more QA focussed, splitting it from the Bug Control meeting. Now both groups have different times to meet and discuss their issues and progress, and we have a set of tasks that community members are contributing to, with the aim of improving the quality of Ubuntu. I am driving and coordinating this effort at the moment, but this is not going to be my focus going forward since there will be a QA Community Coordinator with whom my team will collaborate closely and I will be just one more community contributor. The QA Platform team will be helping shape the testing effort and trying to make every little effort a worthwhile contribution to the whole. Historically, there has been little leadership in the QA front, and we are trying to bring good practices from the industry to the open-source community to improve the situation.

我们把会议从Bug Control会议中分离出来，并改变其形式使其跟着重于QA。现在两组人分开时间集会并讨论他们的问题和进展，我们有一个社区成员为了提高Ubuntu的质量，正在贡献的任务列表。目前我负责推动并协调这项工作，但这不是我的工作中心，因为会有专门的QA社区协调员，我们小组会跟这些人紧密合作，而我只是另外一个社区贡献者。QA平台小组帮助推进测试并使每个小小的努力都能成为整体中有价值的贡献。历史上来讲，QA方面的领导很少，我们致力于为从行业到开源社区的用户带来好的实践来改善这种情况。。

EK: Do you have any suggestions for others who are looking to get involved with Ubuntu and open-source in general?

EK：对想参与到Ubuntu和开源社区的人有什么建议吗？

GG: I think open-source is an unstoppable force that is driven by a huge worldwide community. I'd say the first step is to figure out what you want to do with your free time, then choose a project that you'd like to contribute to and see if they are in need of any of your skills; odds are they are. If you are a developer but do not want to write code in your free time, you might enjoy reviewing code or beta-testing a product to find problems, or triaging some bugs. Maybe you are good at languages and want to contribute by translating the software.

GG：我认为开源是由社区推动的一股不可逆转的力量。我想说，第一步，你需要知道空闲时间里面你想干什么，然后参与到一个你想为之贡献的项目并看项目中是否需要你的其他技能； ***odds are they are***. 如果你本来就是一名开发人员，不想在空闲时间写代码，你可能会喜欢审阅代码或者beta测试一个产品来发现问题，或者跟踪bug。可能你擅长语言并愿意翻译软件来贡献。

Or if you enjoy breaking software, and would like to do quality assurance and testing of a particular product, and you are prepared to join a very dynamic and challenging environment, I'd like to see an email from you on our ubuntu-qa@lists.ubuntu.com list (it's open to anyone: https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-qa ).

或者要是你喜欢调试软件，想做某个软件的质量保证和测试工作，而且准备好进入一个非常具有活力和挑战的环境，你可以发邮件到ubuntu-qa@lists.ubuntu.com(这个邮件列表对大家都开放：https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-qa)。

We are in the process of gathering as much help as we can get. The tasks that are being worked on at the moment at the community level for Precise are available on the wiki:
